# RoR-Elevator-Service-Tech-Proposal
Using the RoR framework, provide a technical proposal for how you would approach creating an elevator service. This service should support at least the core requirements listed below and does NOT need to support any UI (api only).    Requirements 1. Accepts new floor pickup requests  2. Accepts new floor drop off requests  3. Emergency error handling  4. Order optimization (handle incoming requests before, during and after traveling between floors and ensuring all incoming request for pick up and drop off are handled in a way so that requests do not become stale but also allowing for optimal)
